# Serverless Samples

This repository contains samples of Serverless application code.

- ## lambda-ecs-dual-deploy 

  This AWS Lambda / ECS Dual Deploy Sample Application demonstrates the steps necessary to build a container image that runs on both AWS Lambda and on another container service like AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS).

  [[README]](./lambda-ecs-dual-deploy)

- ## serverless-rest-api

    These REST API examples demonstrate end-to-end implementations of a simple application using a serverless approach that includes CI/CD pipelines, automated unit and integration testing, and workload observability. The examples include multiple implementations of the same application using a variety of development platform and infrastructure as a code approaches. The patterns here will benefit beginners as well as seasoned developers looking to improve their applications by automating routine tasks. [[README]](./serverless-rest-api)

- ## terraform-sam-integration 

  [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool that provides a consistent CLI workflow to manage cloud services. [AWS Serverless Application Model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html) (SAM) is an open-source framework for building serverless applications. Teams that choose to use both Terraform and SAM need a simple way to share resource configurations between tools. [AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html) (SSM) can bridge this gap by providing secure, hierarchical storage for configuration data management and secrets management. This project demonstrates how to create a simple app using Terraform, SAM and SSM Parameter Store. [[README]](./terraform-sam-integration) 

- ## apigw-private-custom-domain-name

  Implements a workaround solution for custom domain names for Amazon API Gateway private endpoints as described in the [blog post](https://georgemao.medium.com/enabling-private-apis-with-custom-domain-names-aws-api-gateway-df1b62b0ba7c). [[README]](./apigw-private-custom-domain-name)

- ## fargate-rest-api

  These examples focus on creating REST APIs with Amazon API Gateway, Amazon ECS, and AWS Fargate. The examples include CI/CD pipelines, automated unit and integration tests, as well as workload observability. The examples include multiple implementations of the same application using a variety of development platform and infrastructure as a code approaches. The patterns here will benefit beginners as well as seasoned developers looking to improve their applications by automating routine tasks. [[README]](./fargate-rest-api)

- ## fargate-private-api

  These private API examples, using Amazon API Gateway REST APIs, utilizes private API, and private integration, along with Amazon Cognito as the identity provider. The patterns here will benefit high security compliance organizations, such as Public Sector customers, to implement end to end private serverless APIs. The examples include CI/CD pipelines, automated unit and integration tests, as well as workload observability. [[README]](./fargate-private-api)

- ## multiregional-private-api

  The AWS global footprint enables customers to support applications with near zero Recovery Time Objective (RTO) requirements. Customers can run workloads in multiple regions, in a multi-site active/active manner, and serve traffic from all regions. To do so, developers often need to implement private multi-regional APIs that are used by the applications.Â  This example shows how to implement such a solution using Amazon API Gateway and Amazon Route 53. [[README]](./multiregional-private-api)

- ## apigw-ws-integrations

  Developers use the WebSocket protocol for bidirectional communications in their applications. With Amazon API Gateway [WebSocket APIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-websocket-api.html) you can build bidirectional communication applications without having to provision and manage servers. Many WebSocket samples use AWS Lambda or HTTP(s) as the integration targets and for connect/disconnect routes. This example uses the AWS service integration pattern to show how to simplify serverless architectures. It also shows you how to implement URL path support for WebSocket APIs in Amazon API Gateway using Amazon CloudFront and CloudFront Functions. [README](./apigw-ws-integrations)
